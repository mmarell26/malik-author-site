            <p>
              Malik R. Marell is a father, veteran, real estate investor, and
              builder of men. He has survived trauma, chaos, and heartbreak – and
              transformed that pain into a blueprint for purpose, healing, and
              legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through his writing, Malik doesn’t pretend to be perfect. He
              writes from the middle of the fight – from custody battles, family
              responsibilities, business pressure, and spiritual warfare – with
              one clear message:
              <strong>you can rebuild your life from nothing and become unbreakable.</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              When he’s not writing, Malik is building Perfection Real Estate
              Investors, Marell Dynasty Group, and creating housing solutions for
              families and veterans. His work is rooted in fatherhood, faith,
              and a deep commitment to breaking generational cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This author site is your home for Malik’s books, live events,
              and new projects – all anchored in one mission: 
              <strong>helping people rise from what tried to destroy them.</strong>

            <h3>What This Book Is</h3>
            <p>
              <em>UNBREAKABLE: A MAN REBORN</em> is not a “feel good” story.
              It’s a resurrection story – written in raw, poetic language that
              walks through:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Childhood pain and family trauma</li>
              <li>Broken relationships and betrayal</li>
              <li>PTSD, anxiety, and silent battles</li>
              <li>Fatherhood, courtrooms, and custody fights</li>
              <li>Rebuilding as a man, leader, and protector</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Who It’s For</h3>
            <p>
              This book is for men and women who have been through hell and
              refuse to stay broken. It’s for:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Fathers fighting for their kids</li>
              <li>Mothers carrying more than anyone knows</li>
              <li>People healing from trauma, loss, or betrayal</li>
              <li>Anyone rebuilding their life from the ground up</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you’ve ever felt like your story was over, 
              <strong>this book reminds you it’s just getting started.</strong>
